        	We have many activities for you to choose from, both on site and within the area. Many of our visitors enjoy local fishing trips. 
            We have a small fleet of boats that will take you out for either a half-day or a full day. you can also fish in the surf. 
            Beware, though, of Ralph! Ralph is our resident blue heron. He knows what you fishermen have in your coolers and if you aren't 
            careful, he'll take your catch off your hands and make a quick get-a-way.

        	We can also arrange dolphin cruises. We have a unique approach- two boats go out side-by-side about 50 yards apart.
            The dolphins love it because it generates a huge wake! You'll see them jumping right between the boats.
